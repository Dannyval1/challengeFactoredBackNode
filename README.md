# Challenge Factored - Frontend Developer

This project has been developed from Front with React. All the layout content has Material UI and Bootstrap tags. The Back was developed with Node Js and Express Js. The Database was developed with MongoDB.

First, we have a login and register screen. When you register in the system, your data is saved in the database. Once you registered, you proceed to access through the login screen to access your profile.

In your profile you will find your personal information as your name, your position, about you and a spider type chart with all your skills.

## Getting Started

For running this project in your personal computer, you have to open every folder: 
factored === Front and factored-node === Back.

Once you opened the folders in your code editor, first, let's load the packages for Front.
You have to run the command "npm install" in the Terminal inside the Front Project (factored).

When it finished to load the packages, you can run the command "npm start" to run the frontend.

Now, let's load the packages for Back. You have to do the same. Open the folder of Backend and open it's terminal. Run the command "npm install" in the Terminal inside the Back Project (factored-node). When it finished to load the packages, you can run the command "node App.js" to run the backend.

That's way you will have running in one window the frontend and the other window the backend.
